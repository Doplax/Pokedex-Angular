## About 📖

The PokeAngular Pokedex is a fun, interactive application for all Pokémon fans. The application utilizes the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch data and provide detailed information about each Pokémon. 

The aim of this project was not only to create a functional Pokedex but also to gain more experience and learn more about Angular, TypeScript, and working with APIs.
